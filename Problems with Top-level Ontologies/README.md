# Problems and Limitations of Top-level Ontologies

This folder describes some problems with using top-level ontologies and their limitations.

The high degree of abstractness and generality of these types of ontology makes them both open to various conceptualizations, and amenable to philosophical speculation and theory. The mixing of philosophical and technical motivations is, in my opinion, a source of problems as well as potentially dangerous. When engaging in the most abstract concepts, it will be important to clearly distiinguish between any philosophical (e.g. metaphysical) views, assumptions, and claims from the technical (computational, data-centric, practical or goal-focused) choices, goals and motivations. If you are building a computational ontology that is also philosophically laden, then you should be transparent by explicitly stating the assumed ontological commitments in a metaphyiscal sense, and any adoped ideology (methodological or otherwise, e.g., ((non)reductionist, etc.).

## Some problems
- Not all concepts or categories can necessarily be grouped or subsumed under a more generic concept or category.
- Some concepts may be irreducible, such that they cannot be classified under a broader concept.
- The intended meaning of some concepts may be lost by subsuming the concept under a broader.

- High learning-curve: they are difficult to understand for non-specialists (non-philosophers, non-computer-scientists, etc.)

## Technical 
- For the more complex and logically formalized ontologies...
  - They increase the 'path' between data elements, i.e., to access or otherwise perform some action on data

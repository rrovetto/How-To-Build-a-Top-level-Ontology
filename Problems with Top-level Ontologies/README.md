# Problems and Limitations of Top-level Ontologies

This folder describes some problems with using top-level ontologies and their limitations.

The high degree of abstractness and generality of these types of ontology makes them both open to various conceptualizations, and amenable to philosophical speculation and theory. The mixing of philosophical and technical motivations is, in my opinion, a source of problems as well as potentially dangerous. When engaging in the most abstract concepts, it will be important to clearly distiinguish between any philosophical (e.g. metaphysical) views, assumptions, and claims from the technical (computational, data-centric, practical or goal-focused) choices, goals and motivations. If you are building a computational ontology that is also philosophically laden, then you should be transparent by explicitly stating the assumed ontological commitments in a metaphyiscal sense, and any adoped ideology (methodological or otherwise, e.g., ((non)reductionist, etc.).

## Some problems
- Not all concepts or categories can necessarily be grouped or subsumed under a more generic concept or category.
- Some concepts may be irreducible, such that they cannot be classified under a broader concept.
  - Consider how some theories of a given concept, category or phenomena, consider the concept to be irreducible to others. In an ontology, then, it is not necessarily subsumable.  
- The intended meaning of some concepts may be lost by subsuming the concept under a broader.

- High learning-curve: they are difficult to understand for non-specialists (non-philosophers, non-computer-scientists, etc.)

## Technical 
- For the more complex and logically formalized ontologies... 
  - They increase the 'path' between data elements, i.e., to access or otherwise perform some action on data
- As with all ontology, quantitative evidence for their utility is lacking or not readily available. If there is such evidence, it may be behind NDAs in enterprises.

""Science and society are in constant flux. Meaning is an emerging and
evolving property of (human) cognition both on the individual and
societal level. Put differently, meaning is in our heads, not in the
world. Meaning cannot be fixed in ontologies. Instead, ontologies aim at
restricting the interpretation of domain terminology towards their
intended meaning. Such restriction aims to maximize semantic
interoperability, i.e., to minimize cases where parties exchange
information that seems valid on a syntactic level but where the expected
semantics of the target does not match the semantics of the source.

Once we leave the ground of concrete domains and their tasks, we lose
the context that helps restrict a domain's terminology and a sense for
the required quality of this restriction, e.g., the choice of axioms. As
a result, top-level ontology becomes metaphysics - useful, but not
easily ground-able. One top-level ontology may declare that there are
two disjoint kinds: objects and events. A second such ontology may
declare that 'objects are just very slowly evolving events'. You can
select the one you prefer, but none of them is wrong. It is also often
unclear when and why one would have to restrict the interpretation of
terminology for a certain, concrete task, e.g., data retrieval, by going
all the way up the abstraction hierarchy.

Personally, I often search for measurement types and face the semantic
interoperability challenge that two different measurement procedures go
by the same name. I rarely search for things that are 'substances',
'occurrences', or 'forms'. All that said, I fully understand the
intellectual joy of designing and studying these top-level ontologies,
but I see their use in providing us with answers to the big questions of
what can be said and which distinctions make sense and less on the level
of actionable theories."

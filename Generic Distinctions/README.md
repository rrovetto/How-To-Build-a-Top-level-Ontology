## Generic / Abstract Distinctions

The highly abstract nature of the following distinctions is characteristic of philosophical inquiry. Some of the following originate from that intellectual history. The reader is encouraged to review the metaphysics literature (including philosophical ontology), linguistics literature, cognitive science literature, and psychology literature. 
Although I list them using 'vs', e.g., 'category vs. individual', this is not intended to be interpreted as an opposition, contradiction or anything of a negative connotation. The list can just as easily use '-' between the categories, e.g., the category-individual distinction.

* generic vs. specific
* universal vs. particular
* category vs. individual
* class vs. member
* set vs. member

* property-bearer vs. property
* property vs. property-value
* attribute vs. property vs. value

* event vs. object
* process vs. event
* process vs. object
* event vs. event participant

* activity vs. actor

* space vs. time vs. space-time vs. spacetime
* cause vs. effect

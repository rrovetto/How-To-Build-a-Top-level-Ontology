## Terminology

In the formal ontology community, the most abstract ontologies are often called: foundational, upper, top-level, generic, general, or core ontologies.

However...the names 'foundational' and 'top-level' require the reader to understand the architecture: that the foundation is the most abstract, or that the so-called 'top level' is the most abstract in a given ontology architecture.
Similarly, the name 'upper ontology' is not accuarate for the same reasons, but also because 'upper' suggests a gradiation or a variation, and therefore is relative. It is thereby not indicate of the most abstract or generic ontology. 
These, therefore, are not the most appropriate names for the most abstract ontologies.

### ROB'S RECOMMENDATION 
* I recommend the more neutral term 'generic ontology', which is more sparsely found in the literature, but which more accurately captures the idea and goal of the most highly generic or abstract ontologies.

## Terminology

In the formal ontology community, the most abstract ontologies are often called: foundational, upper, top-level, generic, general, or core ontologies.

However...the names 'foundational' and 'top-level' require the reader to understand the architecture: that the foundation is the most abstract, or that the so-called 'top level' is the most abstract in a given ontology architecture.
Similarly, the name 'upper ontology' is not accuarate for the same reasons, but also because 'upper' suggests a gradiation or a variation, and therefore is relative. It is thereby not indicate of the most abstract or generic ontology. 
These, therefore, are not the most appropriate names for the most abstract ontologies.

### ROB'S RECOMMENDATION 
* I recommend the more neutral term ['generic ontology'](https://github.com/rrovetto/How-To-Build-a-Top-level-Ontology/blob/main/GenericNameForUpperOntologies_Rovetto_v2.pdf), which is more sparsely found in the literature, but which more accurately captures the idea and goal of the most highly generic or abstract ontologies.

### About upper ontology
[This](https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2007/06/24/top-down-or-bottom-up-ontologies/) describes top or upper ontology consicely: "In information science, an upper ontology (top-level ontology, or foundation ontology) is an attempt to create an ontology which describes very general concepts that are the same across all domains. The aim is to have a large number on ontologies accessible under this upper ontology. It is usually a hierarchy of entities and associated rules (both theorems and regulations) that attempts to describe those general entities that do not belong to a specific problem domain."

### Critical or problematic aspects of top-level ontology
- We also read this good point: "But my own experience has shown that the creation of ontologies – or any classification – can be an emotive area and lead to serious disagreements. It’s easy for any individual to imagine that their view of a problem is complete and internally consistent and must therefore be identical to others in the same domain."
- Upper ontologies may add too much semantics (or more semantics than desired or needed), resulting in semantic bloat on databases and annotated data. This is particularly so for heavy-weight (heavily axiomatized and complex) ontologies, and those with a lot of philosophical assumptions and content.
- Upper ontologies are not strictly needed to achieve the goals they are often purported to achieve.
- The high degree of abstractness makes specific semantic and logical formalization contentious: each developer, group, person or stakeholder may have a different sense or intended meaning for the inherently-broad abstract concepts defined in the ontology. (concepts like 'space', 'time', 'object', 'person', 'event', 'process', 'system', etc.)

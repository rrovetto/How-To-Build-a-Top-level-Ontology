# How To Build a Top-level Ontology

This project aims to provide a procedure for developing (a) the most abstract or generic ontologies, and (b) a more generic ontology relative to a given ontology. A step-by-step procedure may help novice and professional ontologists, alike. A minimum goal is to provide a set of guidelines on how to build these (a) generic (also called foundational, core, or top-level) and (b) upper or mid ontologies.

Creating a generic or foundaitonal ontologies may seem full of philosophical baggage because of the **highly abstract** concepts involved. The task involves creating a semantic model that can supposedly apply to any less abstract topic, concept, domain, discipline or universe of discourse. 

SIDE-NOTE: Two points are worth mentioning for both technical and ethical reasons. First, top-level or foundational ontologies are not strictly necessary; one can achieve the same goals purported by the use or development of these generic ontologies. Second, anyone can create their own highly generic ontology, whether incorporated in a more topic-specfic ontology or as a stand-alone separate ontology module. These are worth mentioning because of competition in the top-level ontology community, and the risk of monopolization. 

This project seeks to determine if a comprehensible stepwise procedure can be developed for creating such ontologies. This will make the design and development of generic ontologies more accessible to all. 

Topics inlcude:
* _Generic concepts_: What are the most abstract concepts, and how do we identify them? what aare more generic concepts relative to a given concept?
* _Generic distinctions_: What are some abstract distinctions? where do they come from? how do we form or identify them? 
* _Generic questions_: What are some questions associated with the generic or abstract concepts and distinctions? 
* _Association to philosophy/philosophical inquiry_: Questions from philosophy (e.g. metaphysics)

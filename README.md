# How To Build a Top-level Ontology

This project aims to provide a procedure for developing (a) the most abstract or generic ontologies, and (b) a more generic ontology relative to a given ontology. A step-by-step procedure may help novice and professional ontologists, alike. 

The topic of generic or so-called foundational ontology can seen daunting and full of philosophical baggage. The latter is true because of the highly generic and abstract aspects of the activity and the concepts involved. This project seeks to determine if a comprehensible stepwise procedure can be developed for creating such ontologies. This will make the design and development of generic ontologies more accessible to all. 

Topics inlcude:
* Abstract concepts
* Abstract distinctions
* Abstract questions

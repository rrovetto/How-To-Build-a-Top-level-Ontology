# How To Build a Top-level Ontology

## Purpose
This project explores whether a comprehensible procedure can be developed for creating the most abstract/generic ontologies (aka generic/general, top-level, foundational, core, upper ontologies). It would make the design and development of generic ontologies more accessible to all, and may thereby foster innovation and diversity.

The project aims to provide a procedure for developing (a) the most abstract or generic ontologies, and (b) a broader ontology relative to a given ontology. A step-by-step procedure may help novice and professional ontologists, alike. A minimum goal is to provide a set of guidelines on how to build these ontologies for both scenarios, (a) and (b).

## Background
The task of developing highly broad ontologies involves creating a conceptual, ontological, semantic, or knowledge model that can supposedly apply to any less abstract topic, concept, domain, discipline or universe of discourse. More specifically, it involves creating or identifying highly general concepts and terms, if not the most generic or fundamental concepts and terms we can presently conceive. Given this highly abstract character (the highly general concepts involved), creating these ontologies may be (or otherwise seem to be) very philosophical or otherwise overloaded with philosophical content (or baggage). When philosophical theories or concepts are employed in these ontologies, understanding them can be inaccessible to the non-specialist. Additionally, such ontologies with assumed philosophical theories may in fat not be applicable, appropriate, or desired for a given project, or use-case. Therefore, this project may identify a method to create these abstract ontologies (a) without necessarily committing to an ideology (philosophical or otherwise) or assume one or more metaphyiscal accounts of the world, and (b) for making their comprehension and development more accesible.  

Two points are worth mentioning for both technical and ethical reasons: 
- First, top-level or foundational ontologies are not strictly necessary; one can achieve the same goals purported by the use or development of these generic ontologies. 
  - See [some problems and limitations with top-level ontologies](https://github.com/rrovetto/How-To-Build-a-Top-level-Ontology/tree/main/Problems%20with%20Top-level%20Ontologies) 
- Second, anyone can create their own highly generic ontology, whether incorporated in a more topic-specfic ontology or as a stand-alone separate ontology module. 
These are worth mentioning because of competition among ontologies in the top-level ontology community, and the risk of monopolization. 

## Project Topics
* _Generic concepts_: What are the most abstract concepts, and how do we identify them? What are more generic concepts relative to a given concept?
* _Generic distinctions_: What are some abstract distinctions? Where do they come from? How do we form or identify them? 
* _Generic questions_: What are some questions associated with the generic or abstract concepts and distinctions? 
* _Association to philosophy/philosophical inquiry_: Questions from philosophy (e.g. metaphysics)

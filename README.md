# How To Build a Top-level Ontology

This project aims to provide a procedure for developing (a) the most abstract or generic ontologies, and (b) a more generic ontology relative to a given ontology. A step-by-step procedure may help novice and professional ontologists, alike. The topic of foundational ontology can seen daunting and full of philosophical baggage. The latter is true because of the highly generic and abstract aspects of the activity and the concepts involved. However, this project seeks to determine if an easily-comprehensible step-wise process can be developed. This will make the design and development of generic ontologies more accessible to all.

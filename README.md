# How To Build a Top-level Ontology

This project aims to provide a procedure for developing (a) the most abstract or generic ontologies, and (b) a more generic ontology relative to a given ontology. A step-by-step procedure may help novice and professional ontologists, alike. A minimum goal is to provide a set of guidelines on how to build these (a) generic (also called foundational, core, or top-level) and (b) upper or mid ontologies. This project seeks to determine if a comprehensible stepwise procedure can be developed for creating such ontologies. This will make the design and development of generic ontologies more accessible to all. 

The task of developing these most-generic ontologies involves creating a conceptual, ontological, semantic, or knowledge model that can supposedly apply to any less abstract topic, concept, domain, discipline or universe of discourse. Creating generic or foundaitonal ontologies may be (or otherwise seem to be) overloaded with philosophical baggage because of the **highly abstract** concepts involved; and as such ontologies with assumed philosophical theories may not be applicable, appropriate or desired for a given project, use-case, etc. Therefore, this project may identify a method to create these abstract ontologies without necessarily committing to an ideology (philosophical or otherwise) or assume one or more metaphyiscal accounts of the world.  

SIDE-NOTE: Two points are worth mentioning for both technical and ethical reasons. First, top-level or foundational ontologies are not strictly necessary; one can achieve the same goals purported by the use or development of these generic ontologies. Second, anyone can create their own highly generic ontology, whether incorporated in a more topic-specfic ontology or as a stand-alone separate ontology module. These are worth mentioning because of competition in the top-level ontology community, and the risk of monopolization. 

Topics for this project inlcude:
* _Generic concepts_: What are the most abstract concepts, and how do we identify them? What are more generic concepts relative to a given concept?
* _Generic distinctions_: What are some abstract distinctions? Where do they come from? How do we form or identify them? 
* _Generic questions_: What are some questions associated with the generic or abstract concepts and distinctions? 
* _Association to philosophy/philosophical inquiry_: Questions from philosophy (e.g. metaphysics)

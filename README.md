# How To Build a Top-level Ontology

This project aims to provide a procedure for developing (a) the most abstract or generic ontologies, and (b) a more generic ontology relative to a given ontology. A step-by-step procedure may help novice and professional ontologists, alike. A minimum goal is to provide a set of guidelines on how to build these (a) generic (also called foundational, core, or top-level) and (b) upper or mid ontologies.

Creating a generic or foundaitonal ontologies may seem full of philosophical baggage because of the **highly abstract** concepts involved. The task involves creating a semantic model that can supposedly apply to any less abstract topic, concept, domain, discipline or universe of discourse. 

SIDE-NOTE: Two points are worth mentioning. First, top-level or foundational ontologies are not strictly necessary; one can achieve the same goals purported by the use or development of these generic ontologies. Second, anyone can create their own highly generic ontology, whether incorporated in a more topic-specfic ontology or as a stand-alone separate ontology module. These are worth mentioning because, sadly, in the top-level ontology community there is a history of competition and political maneuvering (to put it nicely) to have their ontology used; some aim to be a monopolizing one-to-rule-them-all where their actions have been harmful (with documented evidence). Therefore, it is ethically and otherwise essential to make these points known to the wider audience.

This project seeks to determine if a comprehensible stepwise procedure can be developed for creating such ontologies. This will make the design and development of generic ontologies more accessible to all. 

Topics inlcude:
* _Generic concepts_: What are the most abstract concepts, and how do we identify them? what aare more generic concepts relative to a given concept?
* _Generic distinctions_: What are some abstract distinctions? where do they come from? how do we form or identify them? 
* _Generic questions_: What are some questions associated with the generic or abstract concepts and distinctions? 
* _Association to philosophy/philosophical inquiry_: Questions from philosophy (e.g. metaphysics)

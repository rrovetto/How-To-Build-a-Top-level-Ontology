## Generic Concepts, Categories, Words & Terms
Asserting broad categories is part and parcel of developing so-called foundational, top-level, upper, or generic ontologies. They may be asserted as natural language words, such as "event" with or without definitions that may or may not have a colloquial definition. Or they may be asserted as bespoke terms. This may or may not be intended to reflect commonsense, intuitive (or other)  mental concepts we take for granted and which in daily life are typically unexamined and difficult to define. The generality of many highly broad natural langauge words and phrases makes them inherently difficult to define in a precise manner. Yet in applied and computational ontology activities, it is sometimes attempted (as exemplified by some existing upper ontologies). We should also note that the nature of abstraction is to limit the amount of precising details for a given thing. Therefore, the highly abstract character of the ontologies under consideration is such that they will (if not should) have few defining characteristics. 

The following highly generic and abstract categories have been examined since antiquity (see ancient philosophical inquiry, such as metaphysics). They have been given distinct treatments/accounts in philosophy, linguistics, and other disciplines. The reader is encouraged to review literature on metaphysics (including philosophical ontology), linguistics, cognitive science, and psychology (especially on the topic of _concepts in psychology and philosophy of mind_), etc.

Some generic or abstract concepts relevant for creating highly abstract ontologies include the following. Some are called _domain-neutral, domain-independent_, etc., meaning that they can be used in or applied to various domains (topics, subject-matters, disciplines, etc.) and they can have instances or examples from those domains.

We can identity or discover these by introspecting and reflecting on natural language:
* What are some of the most generic words?
* What are some of the broadest categories we can think of?
* What are some words that can be applied to various things (e.g. 'thing') and across disciplines?

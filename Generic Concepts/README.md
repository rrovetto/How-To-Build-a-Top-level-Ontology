## Generic Concepts 
The following highly generic and abstract categories have been topics of examination since antiquity (see ancient philosophical inquiry). They have been given distinct treatments/accounts in philosophy, linguistics, and other disciplines. The reader is encouraged to review literature on metaphysics (including philosophical ontology), linguistics, cognitive science, and psychology (especially on concepts in psychology and philosophy of mind), etc.

Some generic or abstract concepts relevant for creating highly abstract/generic ontologies include the following. Some are called _domain-neutral, domain-independent_, etc., meaning that they can be used in or applied to various domains (topics, subject-matters, disciplines, etc.) and they can have instances or examples from those domains.

We can identity or discover these by introspecting and reflecting on natural language:
* what are some of the most generic words? what are some of the broadest categories we can think of?
* what are some words that can be applied to various things (e.g. 'thing') and across disciplines?
